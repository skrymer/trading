3. **Sector Divergence**:
   - Utilities (CEG, AWK) and Materials (CE, CF) outperformed
   - Technology stocks had mixed results with both big winners (ANET) and big losers (CSCO, CSCO)
   - Financials showed strength with multiple top performers

5. **Biggest Loser**: ALB (Albemarle) lost -22.53%, likely due to lithium price collapse in 2024.

6. **Stop Loss Effectiveness**: About 25% of trades exited via stop loss (½ ATR below entry), showing decent risk management.

## Recommendations

1. **Strategy Needs Refinement**: The negative edge suggests the strategy is not profitable as-is and needs optimization.

2. **Sector Filtering**: Consider filtering out Technology stocks or applying different rules for tech sector entries.

3. **Position Sizing**: Given the low win rate, consider Kelly Criterion or risk-adjusted position sizing.

4. **Entry Criteria Review**: With only 33.59% win rate, the entry criteria (Ovtlyr9) may be too aggressive.

5. **Exit Strategy Optimization**: Consider tighter stops or trailing stops to protect gains better.

6. **Market Conditions**: 2024 saw significant sector rotation - the strategy may perform differently in trending markets.
